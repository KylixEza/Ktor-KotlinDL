# Ktor-KotlinDL
Cat VS Dog Image Classification

# Warn
Kotlin DL is not recommended to use nowadays because it still has lack features, especially in layers

# Test
Send random image of Cat or Dog as multipart through postman or something else

# Note
- [Chek here ](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlindl/blob/master/docs/importing_keras_model.md) to export model as h5 and json
- it has bad accuracy because the model was overfitting and kotlin dl does not support Functional Layer (keras.applications) and Keras Layer (tfhub)
